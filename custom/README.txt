Custom templates.

To modify an invoice or receipt so that it is not modified when a new version is released.

Copy the desired template to xxxx_tmpln.php to xxxx.php
eg 
copy invoice_tmpl.php invoice.php

The basic invoice or receipt in the solution will see that the custom invoice or receipt exists and run this in its place.

This allows the modification of font, page size or number of lines in a page.
