This software contains implementations for some of the OTA hotel messaging specification.
To facilitate this, some of the data types values have been taken directly from the specification
and loaded as defaults in the software.
As this software is for small hotels and guest houses, not all types and definitions are used.

OTA Bed types - this is a complete list of the bed types supplied as part of the OTA specification noted.
Data is contained in the table OTA_BedTypes
OTA_Number - the OTA specified enumeration 
lang - language code - eg en-us
Description - The language specific bed description.

OTA Room Amenity - this is a subset of the common room amenities found in hotel rooms.
Like the bed types is it organised by OTA_Number, lang and Description.
Where OTA Room Amenities are required but not found, these need to be added to the database to be available.
When adding additional OTA Room Amenities additional language definitions should also be added for supported languages
otherwise values will always default to english.


Language definitions.
the Database table contains English, Korean, Chinese and Thai.
Where unicode characters are used, the database uses the UTF-8 number versions of the characters to guarantee display
eg &#21488;&#21271; is the unicode numbers for the word "Taipei".
