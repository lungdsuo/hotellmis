The html help files have been generated using the windows doxywizard 1.7.2

Using doxygen.

The doxygen working directory should be set to the "hotelmis" directory.

The doxygen output directory should be set to the "hotelmis/doxygen" directory.

The input file should be "hotelmis/doxygen/Doxyfile"


Ideally the doxygen will generate automatically if these 2 are set correctly.
For convenience, hotelmis should be mapped to the base directory of the nfs share or samba drive, such that /hotelmis will resolve to the correct directory.

If source is not setup in this fashion, then the paths in the doxyfile may need modification to regenerate the documentation.
